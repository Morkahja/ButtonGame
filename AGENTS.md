# Button Game — AI and Contributor Rules

## 2026-10-27 — Evidence and artifact distinctions

- The complete Trap Mode is **implemented** in the current JS source with `TRAP_CHANCE = 0.10`; earlier “not started” quotes were pre-approval snapshots and must be explicitly dated when retained.
- Distinguish source tree from private sharing ZIP: the repository tracks ten **Ogg** clips, while a separately prepared desktop ZIP reportedly contained ten **MP3** copies. The current `playMediaFallback` chooses an MP3 name on clients reporting no Ogg/Vorbis support. Do not claim raw-checkout codec completeness.
- For Wi-Fi scores, `python3 -m http.server` is static-only. Use `scripts/serve-desktop.py` for a desktop-hosted score/presence API. Its ledger and Android-hosted saved scores are intentionally separate.
- CI compilation/debug APKs aren't proof of an update APK. The installed certificate and higher versionCode must match; do not expose or commit a private signing key.
- Do not rewrite or collapse [root DEVLOG](DEVLOG.md), [curated journal](docs/DEVLOG.md), [creative origins](docs/CREATIVE_ORIGINS.md) or rejected approaches. Preserve Babuni.dev's authorship and publication-safe human–AI record.
- This audit performs **source and docs inspection only**, not browser/Android tests or an APK/ZIP release.


## Mandatory APK update signing practice

- **Never label a GitHub CI debug APK an ordinary update**: temporary debug certificates differ across runners. An original-key-signed APK is required to update any existing installation signed with that original certificate.
- The package ID must remain `com.babunigaming.buttongame`; increment versionCode and match the **actual installed certificate**, not just the package name.
- Use `scripts/sign-android-update.sh` or the opted-in encrypted-secret original-key Actions process. The private `Buttongame-signing-keystore.p12` and password must never be committed, pasted in logs, or exposed.
- If a key is missing or does not match the current device, be explicit; **do not claim to have produced an update APK**. Preserve host scores and document the one-time migration boundary if the old debug private key is lost.

**Update — 26 October 2026:** Babuni.dev subsequently authorized full Red Trap Button implementation at **10%** replacement probability, with immediate Game Over and conservation of already-earned pending points. The feature is **implemented in GitHub source**, and the native Android compilation and new trap regression passed in [Actions run 40365295833](https://github.com/babunidev/ButtonGame/actions/runs/40365295833). Any earlier language below saying this mode is not started or not authorized records the **historical status at that time** and is superseded. An Android APK signed with the original release certificate and physical Trap Mode verification remain **pending**. See [the current Red Trap Button specification](docs/TRAP_MODE.md).

This is a Babuni.dev-directed artwork and a software project. Preserve the user's authorship, distinctive mechanics and decision history.

## Authority and scope

1. **Babuni.dev direction takes precedence.** Do not treat ideas proposed by an assistant as approved features. Never attribute the user's concepts or constraints to AI.
2. **Do not redesign the game without approval.** The existing turquoise jacket-button interaction, physical number mergers, Quick Strike, special 21→42 / 37→73 effects, time/score collectors, and Wi-Fi host model are intentional.
3. Babuni.dev has supplied the [nine-item Red Trap Button specification](docs/TRAP_MODE.md), expanding the earlier [six-item historical checklist](docs/HISTORICAL_CHECKLIST_2026-10-25.md). It defines a pre-game toggle, random red replacements with normal button lifecycle, immediate loss on tapping, untouched expiry/shatter, passive +3 points each ⅓ second from center through standard float/fusion, saved mode flag, and red leaderboard icon. **IMPLEMENTED IN SOURCE AFTER EXPLICIT BABUNI.DEV APPROVAL.** The new native build is not yet an originally signed delivered update. Preserve original user wording and do not invent unresolved timing/probability edge cases.
4. **Babuni.dev has already tested and confirmed the working installed game on two phones:** Quick Strike, combos, timers/HUD, sound, player list, guest scores, Game Over live refresh and score persistence. Do not repeatedly re-add these as unfinished QA. Sound packaging is now complete in source; the remaining release gate is to verify the new CI build, then original-certificate sign/install the **same** Android app (not a TEST variant). Beta high scores need not be preserved.
5. **Keep this a simple game.** Do not add an unnecessary score submission retry, complicated startup protection or abstract hardening as milestones without a real user-observed problem or explicit request. Bluetooth and peer-to-peer are exploratory ideas, not roadmap milestones. Never replace or rewrite the archived Flash game or earlier reconstruction while editing the modern game.

## Inspect before editing

- Check GitHub `main` state and open files/commits before describing anything as implemented.
- Distinguish code present, CI-tested, locally verified, device-verified, signed and actually delivered.
- Review [CONCEPT.md](CONCEPT.md), [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md), [docs/DECISIONS.md](docs/DECISIONS.md) and relevant [docs/DEVLOG.md](docs/DEVLOG.md) / legacy [DEVLOG.md](DEVLOG.md).
- Avoid a false "fixed" claim solely because an API route, fallback, or successful APK compile exists.

## Source changes

- Current browser source: `index.html`, `game.js`, `assets/`.
- Android mirror: `android/app/src/main/assets/www/`. Keep mirrored source synchronized and explicitly verify byte equality.
- The three newer custom sounds exist under `sfx/` in current GitHub; current sync script only takes `assets/sfx/`. Fix source-to-bundle handling as a targeted release task and test for missing assets.
- Native Kotlin code is under `android/app/src/main/java/com/babunigaming/buttongame/`. Host remains the only authoritative leaderboard store. Do not add persistent guest score caches.
- Use reviewable, limited changes and test failure conditions as well as success.

## Android and secrets

- Preserve `applicationId = com.babunigaming.buttongame` for normal upgrades.
- Verify signing certificate continuity before distributing an update. Never commit, log, paste, upload or fabricate keystores, private keys, store/key passwords or personal credentials.
- CI's unsigned release and debug APK are **not** substitutes for an installable original-certificate update.
- Do not assert an Android device test, Wi-Fi acceptance test or completed release without direct verification.

## Required project record

For substantive code or design work, update the relevant documents in the same reviewable change:

- `README.md`: overview and current status.
- `CONCEPT.md`: creative purpose and explicitly approved feature boundaries.
- `ROADMAP.md`: active tasks and their evidence-backed statuses.
- `CHANGELOG.md`: changes actually implemented.
- `docs/DEVLOG.md`: narrative of Babuni.dev intent, AI proposal, iteration, failures and verification; the original `DEVLOG.md` is retained.
- `docs/DECISIONS.md`: accepted/rejected/deferred choices, with provenance.
- `docs/DESIGN.md` and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`: observable behavioral/technical changes.
- `docs/CONTENT.md` and `docs/AI_COLLABORATION.md`: publication-safe portfolio and attribution.
- `docs/QA.md`: tested/unverified cases with reproducible evidence.

**Record format:** date; user direction; AI interpretation/contribution; alternatives or corrections; Babuni.dev's actual decision (or pending); files/commit; tests performed; remaining uncertainty.

Never invent recovered chat dialogue, acceptance, test output, commits, releases, or assets. Unavailable archived conversations remain unavailable until supplied. Do not publish raw private conversations or credentials.

## Verification before completion

At minimum for web-only changes: JavaScript parse check, targeted tests, bundle equality and relevant interaction checks. For Android changes: native compile, host API/persistence tests as applicable, package/signature inspection and physical-device tests when claiming device correctness. For release claims: confirm the exact signed APK, package ID, signer identity, version increment, integrity, source equivalence and intended installation behavior.

A documentation-only change does not validate gameplay, sign an APK, or close release tasks.

## Author attribution

Use **Babuni.dev** as the named project author in metadata and public-facing documentation. Do not describe Babuni.dev with the role label “creator.” Record specific AI contributions separately without shifting ownership of original ideas.
