# Button Game — Human / AI Collaboration Record

## 2026-10-27 — Sequential portfolio audit #27

**Babuni.dev direction:** Continue the repository-by-repository documentation audit, preserving original 2009 game authorship, recovered creative ideas, alternative directions, decisions, implementation and verification. The creator has already supplied historic dialogue for a publication-safe [creative origins](CREATIVE_ORIGINS.md) synthesis; that is not permission to publish a private transcript.

**AI work here:** Identify ButtonGame as the next relevant GitHub repository; inspect source, commits, test files and the existing 11 canonical docs; clarify implemented 10% Trap Mode versus earlier “not started” text; clarify separate Android/desktop host score ownership and the **Ogg-only Git tree versus the separately prepared Ogg+MP3 desktop ZIP**. Add targeted, dated evidence without rewriting or claiming ownership of the original concept.

**Limit:** This is editorial/source analysis, not a new score/Trap Mode implementation, physical two-device test, fresh passed CI run, audio confirmation, signed Android update or downloadable ZIP. All runtime sources, media, extra historical journals and private signing data remain unchanged. Preserve the already documented mistaken AI assumptions and Babuni.dev's corrective feedback rather than laundering them into creator-approved choices.


## Principle

Babuni.dev owns the creative direction of Button Game. AI assistance is a tool used for interpretation, coding, testing, drafting and historical synthesis. **Babuni.dev's ideas are never retroactively attributed to an AI**, and an AI suggestion is not accepted simply because it appears in a chat or draft.

## Evidence hierarchy

1. Explicit Babuni.dev direction or decision preserved in accessible discussion or provided documents.
2. Files, commits, tests and successful/failed CI runs at a specific revision.
3. Dated original `DEVLOG.md` / `CHANGELOG.md` explaining recorded iterations.
4. Retrospective summaries, including Babuni.dev-provided 2026-10-26 "Complete To-Do List".
5. Inference or proposal, always clearly labelled and never turned into a historical fact.

Missing archived messages must remain **unrecovered**, not paraphrased from imagination. Babuni.dev first supplied an earlier [seven-category checklist](HISTORICAL_CHECKLIST_2026-10-25.md) with six Trap Mode requirements, then a more detailed standalone [nine-item Red Trap Button specification](TRAP_MODE.md), including the explicit intent to reward patience and punish careless tapping. Neither document is equivalent to accessing the complete original conversation. At the time of that historical checklist, Babuni.dev explicitly said the **entire feature was not started** and requested documentation rather than immediate implementation; the feature was **subsequently approved and implemented on 26 October**, which supersedes that earlier status.

## What each substantial entry records

| Field | Required content |
| --- | --- |
| Date and scope | Precise work session / repository |
| User direction | What Babuni.dev requested, intended or objected to |
| AI contribution | Suggested alternatives, generated implementation or investigation |
| Iteration | Rejected attempts, corrections, technical failures and trade-offs |
| Decision | Accepted, rejected, deferred or pending; explicit attribution |
| Implementation | Exact paths and commit/PR when changed |
| Verification | What actually ran and its result; distinguish CI from device testing |
| Remaining uncertainty | Unverified behavior, missing source or unresolved approval |

## Direct recovery of the original concept dialogue (26 October 2026)

The original chat's **beginning** is now available through a private Babuni.dev-supplied markdown export. This is stronger provenance than the earlier seven-category retrospective checklist, while still not proof that every embedded image, attachment or exchange has been preserved. See [CREATIVE_ORIGINS.md](CREATIVE_ORIGINS.md).

At the opening Babuni.dev explicitly identified an old game they had already remade locally, then delivered creative notes before asking for a to-do list. **AI's first role was organizing existing author instructions.** Babuni.dev chose the turquoise four-hole/white-ring button, rejected inaccurate AI color/detail proposals, controlled the shatter's fidelity, specified the points-as-physical-value interaction, and later reshaped the 21→42 animation after an already implemented first version. This sequence must remain credited to **Babuni.dev** rather than described as AI-devised features. AI implementations and error corrections are recorded separately.

The raw export is **not safe to publish as-is** because it contains private text and signing-sensitive material. A reviewable edited account is committed instead; do not upload the raw transcript into this public repository.

## Concrete project examples

- **Button shatter:** first AI-produced approximation enlarged the button and used arbitrary glowing shapes; Babuni.dev rejected that appearance. The revised solution fractured the recognizable turquoise jacket button into its actual pieces. This change of direction is part of the artwork.
- **High-score ownership:** Babuni.dev-directed one-host ledger superseded a guest-local score supplementation approach. The latter should remain documented as an abandoned attempt rather than described as current behavior.
- **Android native build:** earlier packaged APKs contained modern web assets but stale Kotlin binaries; later CI compiled the native v2 storage. Successful compilation is not equivalent to an already-installed release.
- **Guest Game Over bug:** user observed missing refresh; assistant traced a client polling condition and implemented a testable change. Physical two-device outcome is still open.

## Recovered collaboration and corrective feedback (2026-10-24–26)

**Faithful shatter.** Babuni.dev did not merely request “an explosion.” A first AI prototype enlarged/faded the button and substituted glowing polygon debris; Babuni.dev rejected it and insisted on the same four-hole turquoise button visibly cracking apart. AI subsequently restructured the fragment animation around the real SVG and updated timed states. The correction belongs to Babuni.dev and should be presented alongside the less accurate first try.

**Numeric choreography.** A working AI implementation of the 21→42 transformation duplicated 21 onscreen `1`s into 42 visual singles. The later Babuni.dev direction was more particular: 21 independent singles should move, bounce, each transform to `2` in flight, and finally assemble 42. An implementation that passed tests was **not** automatically an accepted visual concept; the follow-up request superseded it. AI implemented the revised version and recorded conservation and simulated motion checks. Avoid claiming the doubling-to-42-units version is Babuni.dev's final design.

**Readability over algorithmic convenience.** Babuni.dev's iterative critiques and requests led to slower number growth, collision boundaries that respect entire rotated text, a collectible score bank with its own visible arithmetic, refined HUD grouping, and subtle peripheral score preview. Several changes required technical reinterpretation, e.g. moving pickup flights outside a clipped stage stacking context. Distinguish aesthetic criteria supplied by Babuni.dev from geometry and DOM solutions designed by AI.

**Misrepresenting release status.** AI repeatedly produced web-only repackaged APKs while referring to saved host statistics that were not yet present in compiled Kotlin. Babuni.dev challenged the discrepancy. Full native GitHub Actions compilation was the required corrective implementation, not proof earlier deliverables were complete. Later, when asked for a normal signed update, AI invented a separate TEST variant to protect disposable scores despite explicit Babuni.dev rejection of that concern; the branch changes were reverted. Record both failures as assistant-origin mistakes, **never** as Babuni.dev-approved experiments. Repeated unresolvable chat download links reinforced the difference between “file built” and “release received.”

**One ledger and spectator freshness.** Babuni.dev specified that all Wi-Fi players submit to one Android-host-owned scoreboard. AI's temporary guest-local statistics cache was an incorrect attempt to bridge the old native host and was removed. Babuni.dev then discovered the stationary Game Over list did not update when another player submitted; AI found a polling condition that excluded Game Over and implemented a targeted 3-second refresh and CI check. Actual two-device verification remains a distinct task.

**Evidence and boundaries — earlier investigation.** The first 2026-10-26 search did not retrieve the archived red/trap discussion. A subsequent **Babuni.dev-supplied copy of an older seven-category checklist** recovered concrete Trap Mode requirements and is preserved at [HISTORICAL_CHECKLIST_2026-10-25.md](HISTORICAL_CHECKLIST_2026-10-25.md). **Later in the same day the privately uploaded transcript recovered the actual opening and original trap discussion**, summarized in [CREATIVE_ORIGINS.md](CREATIVE_ORIGINS.md). This still does not establish exact spawn probability, settle every edge case or authorize implementation. A red record button from an unrelated project is not valid evidence for Button Game. Future history entries should distinguish (a) user recollection, (b) Babuni.dev-pasted historical text, (c) directly quoted original archived dialogue if obtained, (d) retrospective GitHub logs, and (e) independently tested code.

## Publication rule

Publish an edited account of collaboration, never a raw private transcript. Do not expose credentials, keystore details beyond nonsecret identity checks, personal chat metadata or unrelated information. When a retrospective summary conflicts with the checked-in source, explain and correct it with evidence while retaining the earlier record as history.
