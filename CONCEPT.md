# Button Game — Creative Concept

**Author and creative direction:** Babuni.dev.  
**State:** A reconstruction of the demonstrable concept, not a claim to recover every discussion from the inaccessible long development chat.  
**Last reviewed:** 2026-10-26.

## Core experience

The player tries to score as much as possible within a round begun by striking a single moving button. Its simple input conceals a layered, tactile system: a four-hole turquoise jacket button appears, reacts to rapid hits, fractures into recognizable pieces, and returns elsewhere. Each press releases a number into the playfield. Numbers bounce and combine; their transformations become part of the spectacle rather than merely updating a counter.

The intended feeling is a playful physical toy, not a menu-heavy game. Numbers have motion and apparent weight. Scores are *earned and collected visibly*: floating values and special effects move to a green score balance before being credited to the white Points total. Golden time bonuses likewise fly to a separate balance and flow into the countdown. Game Over waits for pending earned rewards to finish resolving.

## Currently implemented mechanics (source level)

- 450 × 450 logical stage, 60-second starting countdown on the first target press, with legacy-style 15 FPS target-state updates alongside animated visual effects.
- Button appears at randomized stage coordinates with a small randomized tilt. Presses during the button's fade and destruction remain meaningful.
- Quick Strike is available to the first hit after the spawn-in animation in a 73 ms window; successful strikes give that target doubled per-tap points and distinctive visual/audio response.
- Floating score units collide with the playfield and HUD boundaries, merge gradually and eventually settle into the score collector.
- Combination milestones include 7, 14, 21, 37, 42 and 73. Implemented time rewards: 7 → +2 s; 14 → +3 s; 42 → +5 s; 73 → +4 s. Values 21 and 37 are transformation triggers, not direct time awards.
- Special 21 → 42 and 37 → 73 sequences create deliberate center-stage animations and resolved score payouts.
- Game Over provides a scrolling host-owned high-score table and Play Again. A translucent, gradient-faded preview of the top scores is visible beneath the game during play.

These are statements about the current source, not confirmation of physical-device behavior.

## Shared social play

Babuni.dev's **Serve on Wi-Fi** direction lets one Android phone act as host while other players join from devices on the same network using an address or QR code. The Android host controls the shared score ledger; players report final points, reaction time, actions per minute and session duration. This is **parallel local play and shared rankings**, not a synchronized physics simulation or peer-to-peer game.

## Visual and interaction identity

- Turquoise button with four holes, white concentric details, cracks made from fragments of the actual button art.
- Black field, cyan and white interface, green score collector and gold time rewards.
- Compact Points / Time panels above and Reaction / APM panel below.
- Bouncy numerical combinatorics and changing sound cues without losing the focus on one central action.

Specific sizes, animation and positioning contracts are recorded in [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md).

## Recovered distinction: the original Flash game versus the evolving remake

The retained earlier browser reconstruction, `ChatGPT Remake/README.md`, documents the rules it extracted from `Game.swf`: a 450 × 450 black stage, a 60-second timer that began immediately, an initially blank score, one point **and one additional second per successful click**, a target that fades by a random amount per approximately 15 FPS update, then relocates and rotates. It reports that the Flash original had **no sound and no restart button**. These are historical remake-analysis claims and preserved assets, **not proof that the present game should restore those mechanics**. The initial target, old German-language interface and original artwork belong to the earlier stage; exact authoring date and full original creative conversations are not available.

The current redesign deliberately changes the experience from simple instant point/time rewards to visible, conserved point and time transfers. In the October 25 revisions, time granted merely for clicking or button fading was removed: selected numerical milestones now extend play, making combination play meaningful rather than endlessly sustaining a round with ordinary taps. Reaction measurement likewise became a measurement of first contact **after a new target finishes appearing**, not how long the first page was left open.

The numbers are both mechanics and performers. One documented iteration imagined 21 bursting into 21 separate `1` units that duplicated into 42 singles; a later Babuni.dev request replaced that with **exactly 21 physical-looking `1` units**, bouncing off walls and changing into `2`s before all converged to a larger `42`. The 37 event follows a different grammar—travel to a common upper-center stage, visibly reverse to 73, turn green, and enter the normal collector. These alternate approaches are part of the design history; only the later mechanics describe the present source.

The earlier [seven-category checklist](docs/HISTORICAL_CHECKLIST_2026-10-25.md) recovered six Trap Mode tasks. Babuni.dev has now supplied the **complete nine-item feature checklist** in [docs/TRAP_MODE.md](docs/TRAP_MODE.md), including normal button lifecycle parity, untouched expiration and shatter, precisely where passive points emerge, and the red-icon location beside leaderboard names. The concept is documented; **the entire feature remains not started**.

## Historical roots

`Game.swf` and `Game.html` preserve an earlier Flash-era game. `ChatGPT Remake/` is a separate HTML5 reconstruction of that legacy artifact, with its own behavior and retrospective notes. The current game diverges through button graphics, score physics, special combinations, audio, Android hosting and the host-owned multiplayer leaderboard. Keep these stages distinct when telling the portfolio story.

## Red Trap Button — documented game-mode concept, not started

**Babuni.dev's design intent:** “An optional game mode that rewards patience and punishes careless tapping.”

The **authoritative nine-item feature specification** supplied by Babuni.dev is preserved at [docs/TRAP_MODE.md](docs/TRAP_MODE.md). It calls for:

- An optional pre-game **Traps checkbox** with red-button icon.
- Random replacement of ordinary spawns with **red trap buttons** when enabled.
- Red targets inherit the normal button's **position, lifespan, rotation and destruction behavior**.
- Tapping a red target causes **immediate Game Over**.
- Leaving it untouched lets it **expire, shatter and yield the next spawn**.
- Throughout its active lifetime it creates **3 points every ⅓ second (9 points/second)**, emitted from the **center** and handled through normal number physics, merging, expiry and score fusion.
- High-score records store whether **Traps mode was active**, and the leaderboard shows a **small red button beside qualifying names**.

**Status: entire feature NOT STARTED.** This is user-provided creative direction, not an AI proposal or an implementation request. Replacement chance, tie/race handling, pending-score settlement and mode setting persistence beyond the round are not specified. The earlier shorter six-item summary remains preserved in [the original checklist](docs/HISTORICAL_CHECKLIST_2026-10-25.md).

Other exploratory ideas—Bluetooth and true peer-to-peer hosting—do not supersede the established Android Wi-Fi model.

## Non-goals for the immediate release

Do not redesign the core button, invent new game modes, add a second TEST application or implement unapproved features while completing the existing Android update. High-score preservation for the beta test data is not required by Babuni.dev. Reliability, sound completeness, signing and actual two-device verification come first.
