# Button Game — Decisions and Open Questions

**Update — 26 October 2026:** Babuni.dev subsequently authorized full Red Trap Button implementation at **10%** replacement probability, with immediate Game Over and conservation of already-earned pending points. The feature is **implemented in GitHub source**, and the native Android compilation and new trap regression passed in [Actions run 40365295833](https://github.com/babunidev/ButtonGame/actions/runs/40365295833). Any earlier language below saying this mode is not started or not authorized records the **historical status at that time** and is superseded. An Android APK signed with the original release certificate and physical Trap Mode verification remain **pending**. See [the current Red Trap Button specification](TRAP_MODE.md).

**Notation:** Accepted = established Babuni.dev direction or documented decision. Implemented = present in source. Verified = actually checked at the stated level. Proposed = not authorized. Retrospective entries rely on [original DEVLOG](../DEVLOG.md), [CHANGELOG](../CHANGELOG.md), and Babuni.dev-provided 2026-10-26 to-do list, not an invented transcript.

## D-001 — Preserve original game identity while building a modern edition
- **Direction:** Treat `Game.swf` and the earlier HTML5 reconstruction as stages in the project, not replaceable clutter.
- **State:** Accepted for documentation; historical assets remain in GitHub.
- **Reason:** The development process, discarded prototypes, and evolution are portfolio material.
- **Alternative not taken:** Overwrite the original with an unrelated modernized game.

## D-002 — The button must break as the recognizable button
- **Direction:** Babuni.dev rejected the first swollen, glowing shatter prototype.
- **Decision:** Use clipped fragments of the actual turquoise four-hole button with staged cracks/separation/scatter; still allow taps during destruction.
- **State:** Implemented in `game.js` and `index.html`; documented tests in 2026-10-24 history; latest physical-device verification not established.
- **Source:** [root DEVLOG](../DEVLOG.md) (2026-10-24).

## D-003 — Visibly conserved numerical score transfer
- **Direction/iteration:** Rather than credit on tap and merely decorate with floaters, numbers carry `pendingValue` through collision and fusion, then collect into the green balance and finally the main total.
- **Decision:** Pending values must be settled before Game Over and must not pay twice.
- **State:** Implemented; simulated tests historically reported; broader regression and phone QA remain open.
- **Source:** [root DEVLOG](../DEVLOG.md) (2026-10-25).

## D-004 — The Android host owns the one leaderboard
- **Direction:** All Wi-Fi players see the host's results and the four final statistics; avoid divergent guest-local rankings.
- **Decision:** Guests POST finished runs to host `/api/scores` and GET the same list; browser may retain nickname/mute preference but not a separate high-score ledger.
- **State:** Implemented in JavaScript/Kotlin; physical cross-device acceptance unverified.
- **Rejected approach:** Guest-local persistence or enrichment used to compensate for stale native host builds.
- **Source:** [root DEVLOG](../DEVLOG.md) (2026-10-25).

## D-005 — Correct the stationary Game Over screen, not the data model
- **Observation:** Babuni.dev reported guest high score absent from host Game Over view until another local action.
- **Decision:** Poll host scores every three seconds during Game Over and refresh on return; keep host data authority unchanged.
- **State:** Implemented and CI-regression tested; real two-device confirmation open.
- **Source:** [root DEVLOG](../DEVLOG.md) (2026-10-26).

## D-006 — Release the same installed app, not a new TEST app
- **Direction:** Babuni.dev wants an original-certificate, normal-package APK update. Experimental TEST packaging was not requested; no need to preserve disposable test scores.
- **State:** The TEST build variant was introduced and subsequently removed in commits `31c2718` / `c46ee3f`. Signed and delivered latest update **open**.
- **Do not reintroduce** an alternate package identity without explicit approval.

## D-007 — Treat custom sound recordings as first-class source assets
- **Fact:** Three custom recordings are committed at `sfx/4273.ogg`, `sfx/QuickStrikepoints.ogg`, and `sfx/QuickStrikepoints1.ogg` as of `d5ce766`.
- **Current problem:** Web/Android packaged asset trees lack these exact files; the synchronizer copies only `assets/sfx/`.
- **Decision still to implement:** Reproducible copy/sync/check in release pipeline. Do not say this is already fixed.
- **State:** Source recordings present; packaging open.

## D-008 — Red Trap Button: complete Babuni.dev-supplied feature specification

- **Babuni.dev's goal:** An optional mode that **rewards patience and punishes careless tapping**.
- **User-provided nine-item checklist, 26 October 2026:** pre-game Traps checkbox with red-button icon; some ordinary target spawns randomly become red targets; red buttons retain ordinary **position, lifespan, rotation and destruction** behavior; **a tap triggers immediate Game Over**; untouched traps **expire, shatter and permit the next spawn**; while active they produce **3 passive points every ⅓ second (9/s)**; passive points **emerge from center, combine, expire and fuse into the score normally**; store the active mode with each high score; show a **small red button beside leaderboard names** for Traps-enabled records.
- **Evidence:** [Full Babuni.dev-provided specification](TRAP_MODE.md), supplementing the earlier [six-item historical checklist](HISTORICAL_CHECKLIST_2026-10-25.md).
- **Open details:** replacement probability, moment of passive emission relative to spawn/shatter, potential click/expiry races, and interaction between instant loss and unsettled points.
- **State:** **Historically not started at this point; later expressly authorized and implemented in source.** The user supplied its missing specification for historical preservation, **not an implementation instruction**. Do not label source/API changes as already made or treat the nine-item record as a newly accepted release milestone.

## D-009 — Other exploratory multiplayer options
- **Ideas:** Bluetooth hosting, genuine peer-to-peer network model, optional host score reset.
- **State:** Proposed only. None supersedes the current Wi-Fi Android host or blocks the next signed update.

## D-010 — Replace click-based time extension with earned combination rewards
- **Historical baseline:** `ChatGPT Remake/README.md` describes one point **and one second** per click, and the earlier modern build still contained a button-cycle time increment.
- **Revision:** ordinary taps/button fading no longer add time; the modern 60-second round is extended through **7→2s, 14→3s, 42→5s, 73→4s**. The previously used uniform +3-second bonus and direct awards on 21/37 were superseded.
- **Status:** Implemented in game source; prior behavior is historic, not an open TODO.
- **Evidence:** [root DEVLOG](../DEVLOG.md), October 25 “Session stats, dynamic time awards.”

## D-011 — Rewrite the 21→42 transformation after the initial prototype
- **Earlier implemented attempt:** throw out 21 `1`s, duplicate them into **42 units**, gather and assemble 42.
- **Babuni.dev's later requested choreography:** emit **21 units**, rebound against walls and each change from `1` to `2` while moving, then gather into a large 42. They must remain non-scoring decoration until the one exact 42 pickup.
- **Decision:** The latter replaces the former. This is a specific superseded concept, **not** two independently active modes.
- **Status:** Implemented; simulated runtime checks recorded. On-device visuals unverified.
- **Evidence:** [root DEVLOG](../DEVLOG.md), successive October 25 entries on 21→42.

## D-012 — Make Quick Strike a post-spawn challenge, distinct from Reaction measurement
- **Early model:** Quick Strike was coupled to a reaction-time threshold around the 320 ms spawn animation; first idle page tap could distort Reaction.
- **Revision:** 320 ms is the **spawn-in period**; a separate **73 ms** window immediately afterward enables Quick Strike. A qualifying first tap activates 2× values on all taps for that target, including the shatter. Reaction samples start after spawn-in and exclude page-load idle/early taps.
- **State:** Implemented; simulated boundary tests recorded. Physical input timing not yet certified.
- **Evidence:** [root DEVLOG](../DEVLOG.md), October 25 Quick Strike and Reaction entries.

## D-013 — Favor intact button identity and readable numerical motion over maximal spectacle
- **Rejected / corrected:** the first swollen/glowing pseudo-shatter, a floater hit-radius that ignored digit width, excessive number scaling and unthrottled same-frame chain merges.
- **Result:** recognizable clipped SVG shards, rotated full-text bounding boxes, reduced scale, short merge recovery and score conservation. A later revision delayed fracture onset while shortening breakup.
- **State:** Implemented changes; historic alternatives superseded.
- **Evidence:** [root DEVLOG](../DEVLOG.md), October 24–25 shatter, collisions and merge pacing.

## D-014 — Make each milestone and active hit audibly distinguishable
- **Early approach:** a floater lineage rang a bell just once when reaching seven or more.
- **Revision:** ring on each exact eligible value (7/14/21/37/42/73), then assign the special 42 and 73 *reveal* to `4273.ogg` rather than stacking a second ordinary bell. During active Quick Strike, the **activating** press and later presses select one of two custom impact sounds; ordinary hits use existing impacts.
- **State:** Routing implemented; historic APKs included supplied audio; reproducible asset packaging and physical listening remain separate open work.
- **Evidence:** [root DEVLOG](../DEVLOG.md), October 25 bell/sound entries.

## D-015 — Keep a live ranking peripheral rather than obstructive
- **Babuni.dev request:** Show the leading host high scores **underneath** the game with roughly **50%** opacity and a descending fade; do not replace the full Game Over leaderboard.
- **AI interpretation:** `#live-leaderboard` sits below the framed playfield, has no pointer events, holds up to five names/point totals, and hides during Game Over when the full ranking takes over.
- **State:** Implemented in web/Android HTML/JS; device visual check open.
- **Evidence:** [root DEVLOG](../DEVLOG.md), October 25 live score ambience entry.

## D-016 — Trap Mode history recovery: from inaccessible archive to detailed Babuni.dev specification

- **Earlier evidence gap:** The archived chat could not be read; the first recovered seven-category checklist held six high-level Trap Mode tasks.
- **Further recovery:** Babuni.dev provided a standalone **nine-item “Red Trap Button” checklist** with explicit normal-lifecycle parity, untouched expiry/shatter, center-emitted passive points, and the red icon's location beside leaderboard names. See [TRAP_MODE.md](TRAP_MODE.md).
- **Still unknown:** The full archived conversation, precise random replacement distribution, rare event-order behavior, and reasoning not represented in the two recovered lists.
- **Status:** **Historically concept-only at this time; later explicitly authorized.** Retain previous historical uncertainty records as records of what had been known at each step.


## D-017 — Completed physical QA is completed; keep Button Game simple
- **Babuni.dev's direct report (2026-10-26):** Target/Quick Strike, physics/combos, timer/HUD, sound volume and actual UI all tested and work. Two-device Wi-Fi hosting, live players, guest → host high scores, automatic three-second leaderboard refresh, saved four statistics and persistence across hosting restarts are all reported working.
- **Babuni.dev's decision:** Do not keep re-adding these QA items as unfinished. Do not invent a score-submission retry feature because one old submission failed, and do not promote speculative startup/port-conflict handling or other elaborate hardening to mandatory work. No startup/port conflicts have been observed. The game can remain simple.
- **Babuni.dev's classification:** Bluetooth hosting and peer-to-peer are **future ideas, not milestones or roadmap tasks**. The already-defined Red Trap Button remains a separate unimplemented feature.
- **Implementation of this decision:** Active roadmap and QA ledger corrected; canonical `sfx/` audio mirrored into web/Android and build verification enabled. Normal app ID preserved. See [ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md) and [QA.md](QA.md).
- **Verification boundary:** User report refers to already-tested installed game; the newly compiled `1.0.1-beta` APK still needs its CI result and original-certificate signing to be called delivered.

## D-018 — AI organized Babuni.dev's first Button Game ideas; it did not originate the concept
- **Recovered primary evidence (26 October 2026):** The privately supplied development-chat export begins with Babuni.dev describing an old game they **had remade locally**, saying they wanted to collect new ideas. Babuni.dev then independently described Quick Strike flash/spin, button-specific double points, visible bonus-time transfer, golden numbers, the 21→42 spectacle, 37→73, a jacket button and shattering. Only afterward did the assistant organize these creative requests into the first to-do lists.
- **Attribution decision:** Credit **Babuni.dev** with the game's prior existence, expressed direction, requirements, critique and acceptance. Credit AI for structuring notes, generating prototypes, implementation, debugging and documentation.
- **Source:** [Recovered creative origins](CREATIVE_ORIGINS.md). Original text export retained privately, not published.

## D-019 — Green extra-time concept evolved into a golden mirrored collector
- **Earliest user idea:** Place a **green** extra-seconds number by Time; make it count down as the actual timer increases. It was meant to make incoming rewards traceable, analogous to later green score points.
- **Later direction:** Gold became the established visual identity for time-eligible numerical milestones. Babuni.dev then expressly requested **a golden shared bonus-time balance to the left of Time**, mirroring the green score collector to the right of Points. The bottom Reaction/APM elements also became a unified center panel.
- **Status:** The first green-time proposal was **superseded**, not forgotten, and must not be reinstated as an active to-do. The final golden layout is implemented and creator-tested.
- **Source:** [Creative origins](CREATIVE_ORIGINS.md), [visual design](DESIGN.md).

## D-020 — Set Red Trap Button frequency and settle earned score after instant loss
- **Date and provenance:** 2026-10-26, direct Babuni.dev choice following a proposed red-button implementation plan.
- **Decision 1 — frequency:** When Traps mode is enabled, a red button replaces **10% of ordinary spawns**. Earlier 15% and 20% suggestions were alternatives presented by AI and **not selected**. Disabling Traps means no red-button replacements.
- **Decision 2 — immediate loss with conservation:** Clicking a red button causes **Game Over immediately**, but **already-earned pending points finish collecting** through the existing green score-fusion mechanism. This was explicitly chosen over the alternative of discarding pending floating points. Final host score submission must use the settled total; no new points are earned by that losing tap.
- **Design purpose:** Preserve the original reward-for-restraint mechanic without erasing points the player already earned before the mistake.
- **Implementation status:** **Approved as design parameters at this point; implementation was subsequently authorized and committed.** These decisions refine [TRAP_MODE.md](TRAP_MODE.md); they do not authorize implementation.
- **Outstanding design boundaries:** Trap spacing/streak control, rare simultaneous tap and expiry ordering, pending time-bonus treatment and option persistence between rounds were not decided.
